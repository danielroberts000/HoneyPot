- My first step was to down load and install Google Cloud SDK which allowed me to connect to my google cloud account, run commands, and create instances. 
- Next step was to create my project and make sure that everything was being billed properly.This was somewhat tricky because I had not setup an account yet. but onces I did I was able to use the gcloud alpha commands to link my project to that account so that I could start working with the firewall and building my instanes. 
- Once everything was billed I started by making sure the compute services was enabled and got a list of the current firewall rules. 
-Then I got a chance to start working on my Firewall Rules. [Enabling Compute](https://i.imgur.com/PCy6y2J.gif)
